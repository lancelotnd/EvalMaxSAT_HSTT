/**
 * The Resources section contains 3 entities:
 * ResourceTypes, ResourceGroups and Resources.
 * A Resource has exactly one ResourceType.
 * The ResourceType is introduced for displaying (for example: distinguishes teachers from students),
 * and consistency in assigning resources to events, see the Role section below.
 * ResourceGroups are groups of Resources of the same ResourceType.
